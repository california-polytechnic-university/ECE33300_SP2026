# FaultAnalyzer Technical Implementation Plan

## Project Goal

FaultAnalyzer is a Vivado project for the Digilent Nexys A7-100T that uses the
Nexys FPGA as an external JTAG master for a Gowin KIWI 1P5QN48XF target board.
The project scope is a safe diagnostic path: reset the target TAP, shift the
Gowin Read ID instruction, capture the 32-bit IDCODE, then shift the Gowin
SAMPLE/PRELOAD boundary register and buffer the BSDL package-pin samples in the
generated FIFO IP.

This project does not implement target bitstream loading, embedded Flash
programming, or EXTEST pin driving. It uses the IEEE 1149.1 TAP and
boundary-scan architecture for a non-destructive IDCODE plus SAMPLE scan that
exercises TCK, TMS, TDI, TDO, IR shifting, DR shifting, ID checking, and BSDL pin
sample capture.

## Validated Hardware Facts

| Fact | Project Use | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nexys A7-100T uses the `XC7A100T-1CSG324C` FPGA and has a 100 MHz board clock, switches, LEDs, UART, VGA, Pmod headers, and an eight-digit seven-segment display. | Defines the top-level board target and available I/O. | Digilent Nexys A7 Reference Manual |
| Nexys A7 Pmod JA pins JA1-JA4 map to FPGA pins `C17`, `D18`, `E18`, and `G17` with `LVCMOS33`. | External JTAG uses JA1-JA4 for `TCK`, `TMS`, `TDI`, and `TDO`. | Digilent Nexys-A7-100T Master XDC |
| KIWI 1P5QN48XF uses a Gowin `GW1N-UV1P5QN48XF` device and includes onboard USB-JTAG plus support for external FPGA programming through a DIP switch. | Confirms the target board and the need to avoid fighting the onboard debugger. | Gowin KIWI 1P5 devkit page and OneKiwi KIWI 1P5 product page |
| Gowin JTAG configuration mode conforms to IEEE 1532 and IEEE 1149.1 boundary-scan standards. | Justifies using a JTAG TAP diagnostic sequence. | Gowin UG290 |
| Gowin `GW1N-1P5/1P5B/1P5C` devices report IDCODE `32'h0120_681B`; the Read ID instruction is `8'h11`; IR length is 8 bits for GW1N series. | Defines the expected IDCODE and opcode constants. | Gowin UG290 |
| Gowin JTAG reset requires TMS high for at least 5 TCK cycles; after writing an instruction, Run-Test/Idle must be held for at least 3 TCK cycles; IR data is shifted LSB-first. | Defines the required JTAG engine sequencing. | Gowin UG290 |
| Native FIFO interfaces provide `clk`, reset, `din`, `wr_en`, `rd_en`, `dout`, `full`, `empty`, optional `almost_full`, `valid`, and `underflow` style status signals. | Matches the generated FIFO event buffer interface. | AMD FIFO Generator documentation |

## Vivado Project Structure

The project keeps the simplified Vivado-created layout:

    new/
      TopModule.v
      JTAG.v

```

No additional source tree is required. The generated `fifo_event_buffer` IP is
used directly by the top-level design.

## Module Responsibilities

| Module or IP | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `TopModule.v` | Structural top level. Owns board I/O, instantiates project modules, directly instantiates `fifo_event_buffer`, and wires status paths. |
| `JTAG.v` | Generates TCK, controls the TAP FSM, shifts `8'h11` for IDCODE, shifts `8'h01` for SAMPLE/PRELOAD, captures the 244-bit boundary register, and emits FIFO events for the 36 BSDL package pins. |
| `StatusReg.v` | Stores the latest event fields, scan-done state, match/mismatch state, FIFO state, and local error flags. |
| `UartTx.v` | Sends a compact UART diagnostic report from status fields at 115200 baud. |
| `VGA.v` | Generates VGA timing and displays scan status, IDCODE, pass/fail, and FIFO state. |
| `LedStatus.v` | Maps scan status, IDCODE match, FIFO status, JTAG state, and live JTAG pins to LEDs. |
| `fifo_event_buffer` | Generated AMD FIFO Generator IP used directly as the 64-bit scan event queue. |

## JTAG Operation

The required diagnostic flow is:

1. Drive TMS high for at least 5 TCK cycles to enter Test-Logic-Reset.
2. Move to Run-Test/Idle.
3. Move through Select-DR-Scan and Select-IR-Scan into Shift-IR.
4. Shift `8'h11` LSB-first on TDI.
5. Assert TMS with the final IR bit to exit Shift-IR, update IR, and return to Run-Test/Idle.
6. Hold Run-Test/Idle for at least 3 TCK cycles.
7. Move to Shift-DR and clock 32 bits from TDO.
8. Assert TMS with the final DR bit to exit Shift-DR, update DR, and return to Run-Test/Idle.
9. Compare the captured value against `32'h0120_681B`.
10. Write one IDCODE FIFO event.
11. Shift `8'h01` LSB-first into IR for SAMPLE/PRELOAD.
12. Move to Shift-DR and clock the 244-bit BSDL boundary register.
13. Emit one FIFO event for each of the 36 package I/O pins listed by the BSDL.

Recommended hardware TCK is 2 MHz from the 100 MHz system clock. This is below
the Gowin JTAG timing limit and is slow enough for bring-up with external
wires. Simulation may use scaled timing as long as the same TAP sequence is
preserved.

## FIFO Event Buffer

The generated IP remains named `fifo_event_buffer` and is instantiated directly.
Its current `.xci` settings are:

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Interface | Native |
| Implementation | Common-clock block RAM FIFO |
| Read mode | Standard FIFO |
| Reset | Synchronous reset through `srst` |
| Write width | 64 bits |
| Read width | 64 bits |
| Write depth | 64 words |
| Read depth | 64 words |
| Enabled outputs | `full`, `almost_full`, `empty`, `valid`, `underflow` |
| Disabled options | `overflow`, data counts, ECC |

The IP port list to use is:

```verilog
fifo_event_buffer u_fifo (
  .clk(clk),
  .srst(rst),
  .din(event_word),
  .wr_en(event_wr_en),
  .rd_en(fifo_rd_en),
  .dout(fifo_dout),
  .full(fifo_full),
  .almost_full(fifo_almost_full),
  .empty(fifo_empty),
  .valid(fifo_valid),
  .underflow(fifo_underflow)
);
```

The FIFO event word is:

| Bits | Field |
| ---: | --- |
| 63:32 | Captured IDCODE |
| 31 | IDCODE match |
| 30 | TDO stuck-high error |
| 29 | TDO stuck-low error |
| 28 | JTAG timeout |
| 27:24 | Final JTAG state |
| 23:16 | Event type |
| 15:0 | Timestamp |

For boundary-pin events, `event_type` is `8'h02` and the upper data field is:

| Bits | Field |
| ---: | --- |
| 63:56 | Physical package pin number |
| 55:48 | BSDL data-cell index |
| 47:40 | BSDL control-cell index |
| 39:32 | Pin-event ordinal, 0 through 35 |
| 31 | Captured pin/sample value |
| 30 | Captured control value |

If overflow reporting is needed, implement it in project logic as
`event_wr_en && fifo_full`; do not connect an `overflow` output to the current
IP.

## Top-Level Wiring

Top-level board ports use the current `TopModule.v` names and must match
`FaultAnalyzer.srcs/constrs_1/new/FaultAnalyzer.xdc` exactly:

| TopModule Port | Nexys A7 FPGA Pin / Connector | Direction | Kiwi Connection | Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `clk_i` | E3 / `CLK100MHZ` | Input | none | 100 MHz system clock |
| jtag_tck_o | C17 / JA1 | Output | J2 pin 6 JTCK | Nexys to Kiwi TCK |
| jtag_tms_o | D18 / JA2 | Output | J2 pin 5 JTMS | Nexys to Kiwi TMS |
| jtag_tdi_o | E18 / JA3 | Output | J2 pin 4 JTDI | Nexys to Kiwi TDI |
| jtag_tdo_i | G17 / JA4 | Input | J2 pin 7 JTDO | Kiwi to Nexys TDO |
| Ground | JA5 or JA11 | Reference | J2 pin 2, 9, or 23 `GND` | Shared signal reference |

All JA JTAG signals use `LVCMOS33`. The Kiwi 1P5 header I/O voltage is 3.3 V,
so the voltage standards are compatible for logic-level JTAG. Connect a shared
ground. Do not connect the Nexys Pmod 3.3 V pins to the Kiwi power rails for
this test; keep the Kiwi powered from its own USB-C input and use the Nexys only
as a logic-level JTAG master.

Before driving the Kiwi TAP from the Nexys, set the Kiwi JTAG switch for
external JTAG access. The OneKiwi datasheet states that switch ON connects the
onboard USB-JTAG debugger to the FPGA, while switch OFF disconnects the FPGA
from USB-JTAG for external programming. For this project, use the external
position so the Nexys and onboard Gowin debugger do not drive the same TAP at
the same time.

## Expected Output When Configured

After the board is programmed, the Kiwi switch is set for external JTAG, and
the target is wired correctly, the design waits for a scan request. While the
system is idle, the seven-segment display shows the expected Gowin IDCODE
`32'h0120_681B`. When BTNC is pressed or SW0 is asserted, the JTAG engine runs
one IDCODE scan followed by one SAMPLE boundary scan, records one IDCODE event
and 36 package-pin events in the FIFO, and updates the status logic.

A successful scan should produce these outputs:

| Output | Expected behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `led_o` | Pass and status indication through `LedStatus`, including scan state, IDCODE match, FIFO status, and JTAG state. |
| `seg_o` / `an_o` | The captured IDCODE after `scan_done` is asserted. After BTNU/SW14 reads a boundary FIFO event, the display shows `PPCCOO0F`: package pin, boundary data cell, pin ordinal, and control/value flags. |
| `dp_o` | Held inactive in the current top-level. |
| `uart_txd_o` | A single UART line in the form `P ID=0120681B\r\n` for a pass, or `F ID=<captured>\r\n` for a failure. |
| `vga_red_o` / `vga_green_o` / `vga_blue_o` / `vga_hs_o` / `vga_vs_o` | A VGA status screen showing the scan result, IDCODE, and FIFO/JTAG state. |

If the target does not respond as expected, the same outputs report fail status
and the recorded error flags instead of pass status.

## Input Summary

| Input | What it does | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clk_i` | 100 MHz master clock. | Feeds the synchronizers, JTAG engine, FIFO, status logic, UART timing, and VGA timing. |
| `sw_i[0]` | Starts one IDCODE scan. | Same function as BTNC. |
| `sw_i[14]` | Reads one queued FIFO event onto the display. | Same function as BTNU; only advances the FIFO when it is not empty. |
| `sw_i[1:13]` and `sw_i[15]` | Reserved in the current top-level. | Synchronized but not used by the present design. |
| `btnc_i` | Starts one IDCODE scan. | Same function as SW0. |
| `btnd_i` | Resets the analyzer. | Clears the synchronized control state and downstream status logic. |
| `btnu_i` | Reads one queued FIFO event onto the display. | Same function as SW14. |
| `btnl_i` | Reserved in the current top-level. | Synchronized but not consumed by current logic. |
| `btnr_i` | Reserved in the current top-level. | Synchronized but not consumed by current logic. |
| `jtag_tdo_i` | Samples the target board TDO line. | Input from the Kiwi target during the JTAG scan. |
| `uart_rxd_i` | UART receive input. | Connected to the UART RX IP, but not currently used to drive system behavior. |

Suggested bring-up order:

1. Program the Nexys A7 with `FaultAnalyzer`.
2. Power the Kiwi 1P5 from USB-C.
3. Set the Kiwi JTAG switch to the external position.
4. Wire JA1-to-J2.6, JA2-to-J2.5, JA3-to-J2.4, JA4-to-J2.7, and ground-to-ground.
5. Press BTND on the Nexys to reset the analyzer.
6. Press BTNC or set SW0 high to run one IDCODE scan.
7. Check LEDs, seven-segment display, UART, or VGA for `32'h0120_681B` and pass status.

Internal wiring should follow this flow:

```text
buttons/switches
  -> TopModule control wires
  -> JTAG
  -> event_word/event_wr_en
  -> fifo_event_buffer
  -> StatusReg
  -> LedStatus, UartTx, VGA
```

## Testbench Structure

`FaultAnalyzer_tb.v` is the only simulation top. It should:

- include `FaultAnalyzerTbDefines.vh`
- instantiate the DUT and any module-level DUTs needed for isolated tests
- generate `tb_clk`
- drive test reset
- define only shared helper tasks such as reset, wait, and compare helpers
- include one task header per module or IP
- invoke each module task from the main initial block

Each module/IP has one separate `.vh` file named as the module or IP name
followed by `_tb.vh`. Each file defines exactly one non-module task and
contains no testbench module declaration:

```verilog
`include "TopModule_tb.vh"         // tb_test_topmodule
`include "JTAG_tb.vh"              // tb_test_jtag
`include "StatusReg_tb.vh"         // tb_test_statusreg
`include "fifo_event_buffer_tb.vh" // tb_test_fifo_event_buffer
`include "LedStatus_tb.vh"         // tb_test_ledstatus
`include "UartTx_tb.vh"            // tb_test_uarttx
`include "VGA_tb.vh"               // tb_test_vga
```

The main testbench calls `tb_test_topmodule()`, `tb_test_jtag()`,
`tb_test_statusreg()`, `tb_test_fifo_event_buffer()`,
`tb_test_ledstatus()`, `tb_test_uarttx()`, and `tb_test_vga()` directly. It
should not contain module-specific stimulus beyond helper tasks and dispatch.

Required scenarios:

| Test Task | Minimum Scenario |
| --- | --- |
| `tb_test_topmodule` | Reset, idle outputs, direct module connectivity smoke check. |
| `tb_test_jtag` | Good IDCODE scan, wrong IDCODE scan, stuck-low TDO, stuck-high TDO, timeout. |
| `tb_test_statusreg` | Event capture, match/mismatch flag decode, local overflow flag decode. |
| `tb_test_fifo_event_buffer` | Reset empty, write one event, read one event, underflow attempt. |
| `tb_test_ledstatus` | LED mapping for scan done, pass/fail, FIFO status, JTAG pin monitor. |
| `tb_test_uarttx` | 115200 baud bit timing and one diagnostic message frame. |
| `tb_test_vga` | 640x480 sync timing and status field changes. |
